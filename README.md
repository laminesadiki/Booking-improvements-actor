Apify actor for extracting data about hotels from Booking.com.

Booking.com provides various types of accommodation all around the world. The user interface
is quite friendly for a human user, however to get the data in a machine processable format
is not a simple task, since there is no official Booking.com API. This is where this new Apify
actor comes in handy.

This actor extracts hotel data from Booking.com, it can either extract directly from
the hotel list page or navigate to the detail page to get more detailed information.
The results can be ordered by any criteria supported by Booking.com.

Since Booking.com allows only 1000 search results, in case you need to download more,
you will need to utilize the `useFilters` attribute to tell the crawler to enqueue all the criteria
filtered pages. This will overcome the limit, but will significantly increase the crawling time.

## Input attributes

Input is a JSON object with the following properties:

```javascript
{
    "search": SEARCH_QUERY,
    "destType": DESTINATION_TYPE,
    "simple": EXTRACT_FROM_LIST,
    "useFilters": USE_CRITERIA_FILTERING,
    "minScore": MINIMUM_HOTEL_RATING,
    "maxPages": MAXIMUM_PAGINATION_PAGES,
    "concurrency": MAXIMUM_CONCURRENT_PAGES,
    "checkIn": CHECK_IN_DATE,
    "checkOut": CHECK_OUT_DATE,
    "rooms": NUMBER_OF_ROOMS,
    "adults": NUMBER_OF_ADULTS,
    "children": NUMBER_OF_CHILDREN,
    "currency": PREFERRED_CURRENCY,
    "language": PREFERRED_LANGUAGE,
    "sortBy": BOOKING_SORT_TYPE,
    "propertyType": PROPERTY_TYPE,
    "minMaxPrice": MIN_MAX_PRICE_RANGE,
    "proxyConfig": APIFY_PROXY_CONFIG,
    "extendOutputFunction": EXTEND_OUTPUT_FUNCTION
}
```

* `search` is the only required attribute. This is the Booking.com search query.
* `destType` specifies type of search, available values are `city` and `region`.
* `simple` defines if the data should be extracted just from the list page, default is `false`.
* `useFilters` sets if the crawler should utilize criteria filters to overcome the limit for 1000 results.
* `minScore` specifies the minimum allowed rating of the hotel to be included in results, default is `8.4`.
* `maxPages` sets maximum number of pagination pages to be crawled.
* `checkIn` check-in date in the yyyy-mm-dd format.
* `checkOut` check-out date in the yyyy-mm-dd format.
* `rooms` number of rooms to be set for the search.
* `adults` number of adults to be set for the search.
* `children` number of children to be set for the search.
* `currency` preferred currency code to be set on the site.
* `language` preferred language code to be set on the site.
* `propertyType` type of property to search, it will use filters, so cannot be combined with `useFilters`.
Must be one of the following:
```javascript
[
    "none",
    "Hotels",
    "Apartments",
    "Hostels",
    "Guest houses",
    "Homestays",
    "Bed and breakfasts",
    "Holiday homes",
    "Boats",
    "Villas",
    "Motels",
    "Holiday parks",
    "Campsites",
    "Luxury tents"
]
```
* `minMaxPrice` min-max price range, it will use filters, so cannot be combined with `useFilters`.
Must be one of the following:
```javascript
[
    "none",
    "0-50",
    "50-100",
    "100-150",
    "150-200",
    "200+"
]
```
* `proxyConfig` defines Apify proxy configuration and default group is SHADER, it should respect this format:
```javascript
"proxyConfig": {
    "useApifyProxy": true,
    "apifyProxyGroups": [
        "SHADER"
    ]
}
```
* `sortBy` sets a hotel attribute by which the results will be ordered, must be one of the following.
```javascript
[
    "upsort_bh",                 // Show homes first
    "price",                     // Price (lowest first)
    "closest_ski_lift_distance", // Distance to nearest ski lift
    "class",                     // Stars [5->1]
    "class_asc",                 // Stars [1->5]
    "class_and_price",           // Star rating and price
    "distance_from_search"       // Distance from city centre
    "bayesian_review_score"      // Top reviewed
]
```
* `extendOutputFunction` Function that takes a JQuery handle ($) as argument and returns data that will be merged with the default output, only when `simple` = false. More information in [Extend output function](#extend-output-function).

## Starting with URLs

Instead of `search` INPUT attribute, it is also possible to start the crawler with an array of `startUrls`.
In such case all the other attributes modifying the URLs will still be applied, it is therefore suggested to
use simple urls and set all the other options using INPUT attributes instead of leaving them in the URL to
avoid URL parameter clashing.
In case the startUrl is a hotel detail page, it will be scraped. In case it is a hotel list page, the result
will depend on the `simple` attribute. If it's `true`, the page will be scraped, otherwise all the links to
detail pages will be added to the queue and scraped afterwards.
The `startUrls` attribute should cotain an array of URLs as follows:

```javascript
{
    "startUrls": [
        "https://www.booking.com/hotel/fr/ariane-montparnasse.en-gb.html",
        "https://www.booking.com/hotel/fr/heliosopera.en-gb.html",
        "https://www.booking.com/hotel/fr/ritz-paris-paris.en-gb.html",
        ...
    ],
    "simple": false,
    "minScore": 8.4,
    ...
}
```

## Output examples

In case of using the `simple` INPUT attribute, an example output for a single hotel can look like this:

```javascript
{
  "url": "https://www.booking.com/hotel/cz/elia-ky-kra-snohorska-c-apartments-prague.en-gb.html",
  "name": "Centrum Apartments Old Town",
  "rating": 10,
  "reviews": 7,
  "stars": 4,
  "price": 86,
  "currency": "€",
  "roomType": "Deluxe Three-Bedroom Apartment with Terrace",
  "persons": 4,
  "address": "Prague 01, Prague",
  "location": {
    "lat": "14.4199419021606",
    "lng": "50.0903216331068"
  }
}
```

Otherwise the output will be much more comprehensive, especially the `rooms` array, which will however
contain data only if the `checkIn` and `checkOut` INPUT attributes are set.

```javascript
{
  "url": "https://www.booking.com/hotel/cz/elia-ky-kra-snohorska-c-apartments-prague.en-gb.html",
  "name": "Centrum Apartments Old Town",
  "type": "Apartment",
  "description": "Situated in the centre of Prague in a historical building near the Pařížská street, 500 metres from the Old Town Square, the Pragueaparts Old town E offers...",

      "roomType": "Deluxe Three-Bedroom Apartment with Terrace",
      "bedType": " Bedroom 1: 1 extra-large double bed Bedroom 2: 2 single beds Bedroom 3: 3 single beds and 1 sofa bed ",
      "persons": 1,
      "price": 85.54,
      "currency": "€",
      "features": [
        "80 m²",
        "City view",
        "Terrace",
        "Flat-screen TV",
        "Air conditioning",
        "Private bathroom",
        ...
      ],
      "conditions": [
        "Non-refundable"
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Compute units consumption
Keep in mind that it is much more efficient to run one longer scrape (at least one minute) than more shorter ones because of the startup time.

The average consumption is **1 Compute unit for 75 actor pages** scraped

## Notes

* The actor will not work without proxy, i.e. if you try running it without setting a proxy, it will
  fail with a message explaining exactly that. There can be a slight difference in price depending on the proxy you use.

* Booking.com will only display maximum of 1000 results, if you need to circumvent this limitation,
  you can utilize the `useFilters` INPUT attribute. However, in such case it will not be possible
  to use any limiting filters in start URLs, because the scraper will override those.

* If you need to get data about specific rooms, the crawler needs to be started with `checkIn` and
  `checkOut` INPUT attributes (Booking.com only shows room info for specific dates).

* Booking.com sometimes returns some suggested hotels that are outside of the expected city/region as a recommendation.
  The ator will return all of them in the crawling results so you may recognize more results than your search.
